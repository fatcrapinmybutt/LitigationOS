# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
- Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
- Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
- Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.


## Standard Operating Procedures

### Database Access
- Always use: PRAGMA busy_timeout=60000; PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
- Verify schema before querying: PRAGMA table_info(table_name)
- Central DB: C:\Users\andre\LitigationOS\litigation_context.db

### Error Protocol  
1. Try operation → 2. Specific catch → 3. Broad catch + skip → 4. Checkpoint → 5. Deadman switch (120s) → 6. Retry (3x backoff) → 7. Tier fallback

### EAGAIN Prevention
- Max 3 concurrent background agents
- Count running agents before spawning new ones
- If SQLITE_BUSY or database is locked → STOP spawning, wait for current agents

### Lane Awareness
Evidence must stay in its assigned lane (A-F). Never cross-contaminate:
- Lane A: Watson custody (2024-001507-DC)
- Lane B: Shady Oaks housing (2025-002760-CZ)
- Lane C: Convergence (cross-lane)
- Lane D: PPO / Protection Orders
- Lane E: Judicial Misconduct / JTC
- Lane F: Appellate (COA/MSC)

### Checkpoint/Recovery
- Save progress constantly — GOAWAY 503 errors kill agents after 27-40 min
- Checkpoint to SQL todos + filesystem every 10 minutes
- On crash: resume from last checkpoint, never restart from zero

### User Rules
- NO hard deletions — move to I:\ or Recycle Bin
- Content-based dedup (peek at documents, don't just hash)
- Save progress constantly
